## Running Ollama Locally
If your application leverages local LLMs using Ollama, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install Ollama**  
Download and install Ollama from the official source: [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com)

**Step 2: Start the Ollama Server**
```sh
ollama serve
```

**Step 3: Load a Model**
```sh
ollama pull <model-name>
```

**Step 4: Run Inference**
```sh
ollama run <model-name> "Your prompt here"
```

Ensure Ollama is running in the background while using the application for AI-driven responses.
